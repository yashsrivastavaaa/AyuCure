# AyuCure

AyuCure is a GUI-based offline software using Python Programming language. In this project, we use some online website as a reference to cure the problems through Ayurveda. It is a user-friendly and very simple UI project and some of the diseases will be listed.  When we select the diseases one pdf will appear which is already stored in the data of the software. This page will contain brief information on the disease , types of disease, cause of disease, symptoms of disease, cost of treatment, natural treatment, and preventions.
